# Django Configuration Problem-solving Manual

This manual is designed to tackle typical problems faced during the setup of Django, offering precise solutions to get you back on course.

## Frequent Installation and Configuration Problems

### Unrecognized Django Installation
If your system fails to identify Django post-installation, make sure that:
- The appropriate virtual environment where Django is installed has been activated.
- Your PATH and PYTHONPATH are correctly configured to incorporate the Python and pip directories.

### Issues with Development Server 
If there's a problem starting the development server, verify the following:
- Ensure you're in the base directory of your Django project where `manage.py` can be found.
- Verify if the designated port (default being 8000) isn't occupied by another program.
