# Guide to Resolving Django Setup Problems

This manual is designed to help you navigate through common problems that may arise during the setup of Django, offering straightforward resolutions to get your project back on course.

## Typical Installation and Configuration Complications

### Unrecognized Django Installation
If after installing Django, your system fails to recognize it, ensure that:
- The appropriate virtual environment where Django was installed has been activated.
- Your PATH and PYTHONPATH are correctly configured to include Python's directory as well as pip's.

### Issues with Development Server 
In case the development server refuses to start up, consider checking these points: 
- Make sure you're in the root directory of your Django project which contains `manage.py`.
- Verify if another application isn't already using the port specified (default being 8000).
