# In-depth Django Setup Guide

Welcome to this thorough guide on installing Django. This resource is constructed as an easy-to-follow, stepwise manual for the setup of Django and caters to users of all skill levels, from beginners to seasoned developers.

## Preliminary Requirements

Prior to starting, ensure the following have been installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python's package management tool)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended for creating isolated Python workspaces)

## Step-by-step Installation Procedure 

### Python Installation
Python forms the foundation of every Django project. To install it, download and set up the latest version of Python from its [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, remember to select "Add Python to PATH" checkbox so that you can access the interpreter via your command line.

### Pip Installation
Pip, a package manager for Python, lets you install and manage additional libraries and dependencies not included in the standard library. Check if it's already installed by running `pip --version` on your command line. If not yet installed, follow guidelines provided on [pipâ€™s documentation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Creating a Virtual Environment (Suggested) 
A virtual environment provides an independent directory tree containing a specific version of Python along with several extra packages. Use this command to create one:

python -m venv django_env

Activate your new virtual environment using these commands:
- On Windows: `django_env\Scripts\activate`
- On Unix or MacOS: `source django_env/bin/activate`

### Installing Django 
Once you've activated your virtual environment, use pip to install Django:

pip install 

This will fetch and set up the most recent release of Django from PyPI (Python Package Index).

### Verifying Your Installation 
To confirm successful installation of Django, execute:

django-admin --version

This will display your system's installed version of Django, indicating successful installation.

## Troubleshooting 
If you encounter any problems during the installation process, please check our [Troubleshooting Tips](TROUBLESHOOT.md) document for common issues and their solutions.
