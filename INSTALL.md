# Comprehensive Django Installation Manual

Welcome to this extensive guide on setting up Django. This resource is designed as a simple, step-by-step handbook for the installation of Django suitable for all user levels - from novices to experienced developers.

## Initial Prerequisites 

Before you begin, make sure your system has these installed:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python's package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional but suggested for creating individual Python workspaces)

## Detailed Setup Instructions  

### Installing Python 
Python serves as the bedrock of any Django project. To install it, download and configure the newest version of Python from its [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During setup process, remember to tick "Add Python to PATH" checkbox so that you can use interpreter via command line interface.

### Setting Up Pip 
Pip is a tool used by python users which allows them to add and manage additional libraries not included in standard library packages. Verify if it’s already set up by executing `pip --version` on your terminal console . If not yet configured , follow instructions given at [pip’s documentation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Creating an Isolated Environment (Recommended)  
An isolated environment provides a distinct directory structure containing specific versions of python along with several other packages.Use below command:

python -m venv django_env

To activate newly created virtual environment run following commands:
-On Windows: `django_env\Scripts\activate`
-On Unix or MacOS: `source django_env/bin/activate`

### Configuring Django   
After activating virtual workspace , utilize pip functionally to configure django :

pip install 

This will fetch latest release package files from PyPI(Python Package Index) and start installing them .

### Checking Your Configuration  
Verify successful configuration using :

django-admin --version

It should display current version number indicating proper installation was done.

## Troubleshooting  
If you face any issues during setup, refer to our [Troubleshooting Tips](TROUBLESHOOT.md) document for commonly faced problems and their solutions.
